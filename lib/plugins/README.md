### How To Create Plugins ‚ÅâÔ∏è

1. Import `anya` from the `plugins.js` file.

   ```javascript
   const { anya } = require(`../lib/plugins`); // or simply use "../lib" path for a shortcut

2. Implement parameters such as `name`, `alias (optional)`, `react (optional)`, `need (optional)`, `category`, `desc`, `cooldown (optional)`, `rule (optional)`, and finally `filename` in the `anya` module.

   ```javascript
   const { anya } = require(`../lib/plugins`); // or simply use "../lib" path for a shortcut

   anya({
             name: "sticker", // {String} name of the plugin
             alias: ['s', 'stick'], // {Array} alias for the plugin (optional, don't include this parameter if there's no alias)
             react: "üåå", // {Emoji} reaction emoji for the plugin (optional, don't include this parameter if there's no command reaction needed)
             need: "image", // {String} needed parameter for the plugin to display on the menu/list message (optional, don't include this parameter if you don't want to display the needed params or it doesn't need any param)
             category: "convert", // {String} category of the plugin command
             desc: "Convert Images/Videos Into Stickers", // {String} description of the plugin command
             cooldown: 3, // {Number} cooldown timer in seconds for the command (optional, don't include this parameter if you want to use the default cooldown timer from the config.js file)
            /** rules
             *
             * rule: 0,
             * - everyone will able to use this command everywhere
             *
             * rule: 1,
             * - only owner can use this command everywhere
             *
             * rule: 2,
             * - only owner and group admins can use this command in the group
             *
             * rule: 3,
             * - only owner and group admins can use this command while bot is also an admin in the group
             *
             * rule: 4,
             * - everyone will be able to use this command but only in private chat

             * rule: 7,
             * - only owner will be able to use this command but only in private chat
             *
             */     
             rule: 0, // {Number} access rule for the command (optional, don't include this parameter if you want to use the default rule 0)
             filename: __filename // {String} compulsory parameter
   }, async (anyaV2, pika, { args, prefix, command }) => {
