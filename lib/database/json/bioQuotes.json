  "[to Hisagi after stabbing him] I am afraid. Then and now, my fear has always been that I would die a shinigami like you.",
  "[to Komamura] Don't make me laugh. Aizen-sama has given me something far more powerful than a bankai.",
  "[to Hisagi] Open my eyes? You? Open my eyes? You never change.",
  "[after Hisagi thanks him] Aren't you clever? Is that supposed to be sarcastic?",
  "I knew it would. Someday we would cross swords and one of us will die.",
  "It must make you sick to know an underling like me is going to kill you.",
  "I was trying to chop off your head from the eye up. A little scratch counts as a miss.",

  "Are you sure? Even if the hidden truth is drenched in blood... Do you still want to know?",
  "I've been wondering ever since before, why do you always look so sad whenever you're with me?",
  "It's all right, for now. Yuki will eventually come to me.",
  "You devoured her mercilessly. She can't even stand up. Was her blood so delicious?",
  "Headmaster Cross, how much longer are you going to keep Zero in the Day Class? That time is approaching for him.",
  "After we turn around, the next time we see each other, I will kill you.",
  "Former humans eventually fall into the Level E category, Yuki. They gradually lose their sanity, reaching their \"end\" - their destruction.",
  "Come on vampires. I've been pissed off lately.",
  "I will keep running away so Zero has a reason to live.",
  "Being like this makes me feel like we've returned to the old days somewhat. Yeah. Zero is Zero. Even if you are a vampire now.",
  "Yuki, I can't accept it after all, that my most precious girl was bitten by another.",
  "You are the only one who brings color into the dull gray ashes that my heart is.",
  "Her warm hands against my face like that... They were like a plank I would hold on to, so I wouldn't drown.",
  "It is the vampire hunter's duty to kill vampires.",
  "That's right...you should run away. Yuki...you make me cruel.",
  "I didn't think that the day would come where you would talk about other guys. How unfair.",
  "Yuki, don't cry. For this day to come, I have waited impatiently for a very long time.",
  "You've finally fallen to the blood lust of beasts, Zero.",
  "You could never betray her, because you are under her obligation. You are being let to live because of that, Zero. By me.",

  "I still think about protecting you two...even if it's considered as an act of taboo by \"humans\".",
  "Go Yuki... Go and be by the side of the man who can spend an eternity with you.",
  "I long for him...but I understand. There's a line that vampires and humans can't cross.",
  "Because Yuui was there, I might have been able to live on...",
  "Yuki is my dear girl. The only one in the entire world.",
  "You're a disgrace to all vampires.",
  "If you need to, Zero, you can drink my blood... *blush blush*",
  "I want these gentle hands... and this kind smile...Even though I should not want such a thing.",
  "Yuki, the safest place is beside me.",
  "Do you want to be a vampire Yuuki, become a blood sucking monster like me....and live for eternity by my side...?",
  "Do you want to be my friend..?",

  "I will never go back on my word, because that too is my ninja way!",
  "By the way, I'm a boy.",
  "*to Naruto* Aww, don't sweat it. Women always go weak in the knees for that cool, elite type of guy. So what can you do, am I right?",

  "*to Naruto* Finding a new me, that is the lesson you taught me.",
  "Hehehe...you can't beat me. You have no skills, unlike Sasuke.",
  "*to Naruto* You've just thrown it all away! Dreams don't come true when you're dead!",
  "Little kids think life is so easy. That's why they go on and on about their dreams. That's why they never give up.",
  "Oh you look so beautiful... We're not here for a picnic you know.",
  "Don't worry, this will be over in five seconds.",
  "We're just some normal ninja, we don't want to see what's under your mask.",

  "It will be a new world... A world of truth, not lies.",
  "When a man learns to love, he must bear the risk of hatred.",
  "*to Sasuke* No matter how far Orochimaru fell, he still loved him... Now I know how the Third Hokage felt.",
  "*to Naruto* You've become as strong...if not stronger than me.",
  "Like the fate of the two who founded the village of Konoha... Naruto and Sasuke...your fates are like theirs.",
  "This place makes me think about the mistakes I've made in the past... and I've made a lot.",
  "Everything will be mine.",

  "*making excuses for being late, as usual* A cute girl stopped me on the way, so I danced.",
  "Naruto, it's nice that you removed the poison so spiritedly, but you'll bleed to death if you lose any more blood... Seriously...",
  "You aren't even worth killing, foolish little brother.",
  "I have long since closed my eyes... My only goal is in the darkness.",
